- ahoy, I'm sysjerm, and that's pretty much all of it really. any further you're welcome to reach out to me at my <a href="mailto:sysjerm@gmail.com">email</a>.
- I currently specialize in security [hacking] research and reverse enginneering in macOS, [L]unix and Windows (not proud of that.)
- anyway, thank you for reading my piece of shit attempt at another "bio" that make the site feel more "social media-like."
